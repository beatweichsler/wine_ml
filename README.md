# Wine_ML: Predicting Wine Quality with scikit-learn

## Project Overview

This university project explores using machine learning with scikit-learn to predict the quality of supermarket wines. We use the X-Wines dataset, which includes over 100,000 wines and 21 million ratings, aiming to develop a model that accurately assesses wine quality from various characteristics.

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The code and analysis for the project.
- **Data Files**:
  - `XWines_Full_100K_wines.csv`: Information on 100,000 wines.
  - `XWines_Full_21M_ratings.csv`: 21 million wine ratings.
  - Accessible via Google Drive: [Data Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vfkfa5deOSsNf3dN2R7xrWWgVXUqD1-k)

## Instructions

### Setting Up

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Get a copy on your local machine.
2. **Data Files**: Place both CSV files in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

### Running the Analysis

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Use your preferred environment to open the notebook.
2. **Run Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially for the analysis.

## Methodology

The project employs statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The approach includes exploratory data analysis, followed by model selection, training, and validation using scikit-learn.

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating relevant features for wine quality prediction.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Using scikit-learn for training and evaluating models.
